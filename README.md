# m8kweb
A web version of m8k, just incase you don't want to / can't install Tampermonkey.

## Licensing
The m8k client itself is under the Apache-2.0 license (included [here](https://github.com/tlras/m8kweb/blob/master/LICENSE)), however several files from m4k are included in this repository in order to make it work; those files are listed below:
* docs/m4k.js
* docs/index.html

**These files are not owned by me, and are owned by the creator of m4k (who can be found [here](https://ourworldoftext.com/m4k)).**
